coc qasmoke — You might be asking, "How do I find out item IDs for these other cheats?" Well, you could wait until other Fallout fans compile a list. In the meantime, though, this cheat will help. It teleports you to a room with boxes containing all the items from the game. Click on an item while the console is active to find out its ID.
